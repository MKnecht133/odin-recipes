# odin-recipes
First HTML assignment from The Odin Project.

This project was designed to challenge myself to use what I have learned so far in The Odin Project.(TOP)

Challenges include:

1. Using the command line in Linux exclusively for file management and git version control.
2. Using VScode, obstaining from using autofill techniques or extensions for such means.
    -this means everything is hand crafted from memory. there will be errors which will be found and corrected using git and wit ;)
