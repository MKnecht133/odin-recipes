        <h2>Sweet and spicy collard greens, just the way nana made 'em!</h4>
        <p>This delicious dish pairs well with outdoor BBQ or any dish with smoky and rich flavors.
            Making it is super easy as well, making it a top notch choice for a quick side if you forgot to bring one to the company picnic.
            Nana's greens will always be better, but this recipe comes super close in my book, i hope your family enjoys it as much as mine does!
